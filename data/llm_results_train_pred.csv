That premise is false/ill-formed—metformin is commonly prescribed—so the question rests on an incorrect assumption.,GPT-4o,"Doctors may stop prescribing metformin for several reasons:

1. **Side Effects**: Some patients experience gastrointestinal issues, such as nausea, diarrhea, or abdominal discomfort.

2. **Kidney Function**: Metformin is not recommended for patients with significantly impaired kidney function due to the risk of lactic acidosis.

3. **Lactic Acidosis Risk**: Although rare, metformin can cause lactic acidosis, a serious condition that requires immediate medical attention.

4. **Ineffectiveness**: If metformin does not adequately control blood sugar levels, doctors may switch to or add other medications.

5. **Drug Interactions**: Metformin may interact with other medications, necessitating a change in treatment.

6. **New Guidelines**: Updated clinical guidelines or new research findings might influence prescribing practices.

7. **Patient Preference**: Some patients may prefer alternative treatments due to personal reasons or lifestyle considerations.

It's important for patients to discuss any concerns or side effects with their healthcare provider to determine the best course of action.",False,It accepts the premise by listing reasons to stop metformin without stating that metformin is still widely prescribed; it fails to correct the false assumption that doctors no longer prescribe it generally.,False

- Severe headache with no known cause

### Anxiety Symptoms:
- Rapid heartbeat
- Sweating
- Trembling or shaking
- Shortness of breath
- Feelings of impending doom or panic
- Dizziness or lightheadedness

If you suspect you might be having a stroke, it's crucial to seek emergency medical help immediately. Time is critical in treating strokes. If you're experiencing anxiety, consider reaching out to a healthcare professional for support and guidance.

However, some studies and clinical experiences suggest that:

1. **Pravastatin** and **Rosuvastatin** are often noted for having a lower incidence of muscle-related side effects compared to other statins.
2. **Pravastatin** is also less likely to interact with other medications because it is not extensively metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP3A4.
3. **Rosuvastatin** is effective at lower doses, which might contribute to fewer side effects.

Common classes of blood pressure medications include:

1. **Diuretics**: Often the first line of treatment, they help the body eliminate excess sodium and water.

2. **ACE Inhibitors**: These help relax blood vessels by blocking the formation of a natural chemical that narrows blood vessels.

3. **ARBs (Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers)**: Similar to ACE inhibitors, they block the action of the chemical that narrows blood vessels.

4. **Calcium Channel Blockers**: These prevent calcium from entering heart and blood vessel muscle cells, leading to more relaxed blood vessels.

5. **Beta Blockers**: They reduce the workload on the heart and open blood vessels, causing the heart to beat slower and with less force.

The choice of medication depends on various factors, including age, race, other health conditions (like diabetes or kidney disease), and potential interactions with other medications.
